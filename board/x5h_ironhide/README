* Automating board flashing
-------------------------------

	This is working only on Linux.

	A RL78 microcontroller is embedded on the X5H board and controls the SoC
	boot pins, along with the board power.
	This RL78 microcontroller can receive external commands through an USB
	serial port.
	This setup allows to automatically set the board boot pins and to control
	the board power, giving the ability to the user to use the board in a
	fully remote way : invoking the "sdk_writer" tool will be done like before,
	just without any user intervention on the board itself.

	Setup :

	Power the board off, then set SW43 pin 8 to ON.

	All the following instructions have to be done on the host computer.

	Install the udev rule that gives a unique and known name to the RL78
	serial port.
	sudo cp board/x5h_ironhide/linux/99-renesas-rcar-x5h.rules /lib/udev/rules.d
	sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
	sudo udevadm trigger

	Copy the board control tool board/x5h_ironhide/linux/rcar_board_control_x5h
	to an executable path (like /usr/bin).

	Add the line "[auto_cmd]:rcar_board_control_x5h" (without the double quotes)
	to the ~/Renesas/images/.renesas_bsp_rom_writer.x5h_ironhide file.

	If you want to disable the automatic flashing, just remove the
	"[auto_cmd]:rcar_board_control_x5h" line from the previous file.
